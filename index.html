  <p>Launched in early 2017, this Icelandic reality show follows 24/24 the life of kittens (who are all siblings)! Do not worry, the initiative is for the good cause (the program aims to promote the adoption of abandoned cats) and does not fall into the cathodic excesses of the "human" Kardashian family version (although the name has a funny ressemblance). Here, the show is done to the rhythm of the life of the cats, that is to say all gently and with a lot of nap time ... If you have not had time to follow the last episodes, You will find a summary : here are the different activities that occupy the "typical" day of a cat over a period of 24 hours.</p>
